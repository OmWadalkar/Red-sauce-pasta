# Red-sauce-pasta recipe
1. Heat 1 tbsp olive oil. Saute bell peppers or onion on a high flame just for 2 min.You can also skip bell peppers and use onion. The taste would be different but good.Set them aside to cool.
2. To the same pan, add ripe tomatoes and saute for 2 to 3 mins.
3. Tomatoes must turn soft. Add red chilli flakes as needed. Set this aside to cool.
4. When cooled,add them to a blender jar.
5. Blend to a smooth or coarse paste. I prefer smooth.Set this aside.
6. While you make the sauce, you can bring 2 liters water to boil in a large pot. Add salt as needed.
7. When the water becomes boiled, add pasta. Cook all dente following instructions on the pack.
8. Drain off in a colander and rinse  to move extra starch.
9. Put back the same pan on the stove with another 1 tbsp oil. When hot, saute garlic and red chilli flakes until they turn fragrant.
10. Add choped onions.
11. Saute until the raw smell goes away.
12. Add the tomato paste you created and salt. Mix and cook on a medium heat until the sauce thickens.
13. Add oregano. Mix well. 
14. Add the cooked pasta. I prefer another tbso olive oil now. This is optional.
15. Saute until well combined.
If you want you can add crushed pepper. Serve pasta in red hot sauce.
Your pasta is ready to be eaten.
